Introduction
Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur are major cities in Thailand and Malaysia and have important roles in Southeast Asia.
I would like to confirm the differences in the characteristics of not only residents, but also those of business and tourism.

Purpose
The goal is to use Foursquare data for clustering and segmentation. 
From the results obtained, common points and differences between the two cities are found, 
and the characteristics of each district are confirmed. 
They hope to be able to find it from data such as residential areas and tourist spots.

Data
The data used in this study is from Wikipedia. 
We would like to compare the characteristics and differences of each area using these location information and find useful information as residential areas and tourist spots.
